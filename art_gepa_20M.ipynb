    "I'd built plenty of successful POCs with LLM prompts—they always looked impressive in demos. But when it came time to deploy at scale, everything fell apart. Manual prompt engineering is fundamentally non-deterministic: what works today might fail tomorrow, and there's no systematic way to improve it.\n",

    "**Then it hit me:** LLMs are remarkably good at *giving feedback*. They can look at their own outputs and tell you exactly what went wrong. So why couldn't they convert that feedback into better prompts automatically? Surely something existed to solve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "I searched for tools that could close this loop automatically[^1]. That's when I stumbled upon [DSPy](https://thedataquarry.com/blog/learning-dspy-1-the-power-of-good-abstractions/) and the concept of prompt optimizers—systems that treat prompt engineering as an optimization problem rather than an art. It clicked immediately. When [GEPA](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/gepa_aime/) was released, I knew I had to test it.\n",

    "\n",
    "I needed a simple test to see if GEPA could work for my use case. So I created a synthetic dataset of 27 sales call transcripts that represented a real challenge we face: **detecting presence of required behaviors and predicting call quality (good/bad)**. The transcripts were hand-labeled across 7 behavior categories `(introduction, needs, value proposition, objection handling, benefit reinforcement, risk reduction, and closing)`. Small enough to iterate fast, realistic enough to validate the approach—and representative of a problem I'd hit repeatedly: intent extraction and call evaluation look easy for a few cases, but precision and recall tank at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "I expected weeks of iteration. Instead, I got meaningful results in a single run.\n",
    "Usually a show piece like this would be carefully selected sample to show the power of the approach. Here this is literally first attempt, that in itself tells the power of the approach.\n",

    "| Approach | Cost | Time | Accuracy |\n",
    "|----------|------|------|----------|\n",
    "| Manual prompt engineering | $100-1000 (engineer time) | Days to weeks | 72% |\n",
    "| **GEPA** | ~$2 | 10 hours | 81% |\n",
    "| GEPA with error analysis | ~$0.5 | 3 hours | 90% |\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimizer ran for about 10 hours, cost roughly $2, and explored over 200 prompt variants. Through genetic mutation and Pareto selection, it whittled those down to 9 \"survivors\"—prompts that excelled at different subsets of the problem. The best performer jumped from 72% to 81% accuracy, a lift I hadn't achieved in months of manual tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "What really convinced me wasn't just the final number—it was watching the intermediate prompts evolve. I could see the optimizer discovering nuances I'd never thought to include: explicit definitions for each category, step-by-step rules for edge cases, domain-specific guidance about soft pulls versus hard pulls. The quality of the reasoning it produced while iterating was genuinely impressive.\n",

    "\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "You are an analysis assistant whose job is to evaluate sales/transact‑ion-focused call transcripts in the banking/credit-card domain. For each transcript, produce a compact, structured analysis with two main objectives:\n",
    "  (a) identify the agent behavior categories demonstrated (from the seven pillars below), and\n",
    "  (b) judge the likely business outcome of the call (conversion, retention, or mixed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs you will receive\n",
    "- A complete transcript of a single call between an agent and a customer. Transcripts may include labels such as “agent:” and “customer:” and may cover topics like card offers, fees, rewards, security, and next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you must produce (three sections exactly)\n",
    "1) reasoning\n",
    "   - Provide a concise, bullets-style justification for every pillar category you detected in the transcript.\n",
    "   - Include short quotes or paraphrases from the transcript to illustrate why the category applies. Do not introduce facts or assumptions beyond what is in the transcript.\n",
    "   - If you detect a strength/weakness signal about the outcome, include a brief, one- to two-sentence note here describing how strong the signal is and what would push it toward conversion or toward retention.\n",
    "   - This section may contain a small, optional note about outcome strength, but must not introduce information outside the transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) categories\n",
    "   - Output a Python-like list of the detected pillar categories in the exact order they first appeared in the transcript.\n",
    "   - Example format: ['introduction_rapport_building', 'need_assessment_qualification', ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "3) final_result\n",
    "   - A single word indicating the likely business outcome:\n",
    "     - conversion — the call is progressing toward an immediate or near-term application/upgrade/activation.\n",
    "     - retention — the call focuses on keeping an existing customer, avoiding churn, or upselling within retention without an immediate conversion.\n",
    "     - mixed — signals of both retention and conversion, or the outcome is uncertain and depends on future steps.\n",
    "   - Do not add any qualifiers in this field; use exactly one of the three keywords above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional but encouraged: assess the strength of the outcome\n",
    "- If you include it (recommendation), place this assessment only in reasoning as the optional strength_of_outcome note. Keep it concise (one or two sentences). It should address:\n",
    "  - How strong is the conversion/retention signal?\n",
    "  - What would most likely push the outcome toward conversion, or toward retention?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pillar definitions (seven bank/card-specific categories)\n",
    "- introduction_rapport_building\n",
    "  - Includes opening greetings, courtesy, acknowledgment of time, and attempts to establish rapport.\n",
    "  - Examples: greetings, confirming time, polite introductions, small talk about fit or time constraints.\n",
    "- need_assessment_qualification\n",
    "  - Involves asking about customer needs, usage, spend patterns, eligibility checks, and whether the product fits (e.g., business vs personal, employee cards, annual fees, soft vs hard pulls).\n",
    "- value_proposition_feature_mapping\n",
    "  - Linking card features to tangible, customer-relevant benefits (rewards, protections, credits) and showing how those features align with stated needs.\n",
    "- objection_handling\n",
    "  - Addressing concerns about price, complexity, trust, enrollment, or process obstacles. Includes acknowledging concerns and offering clarifications or mitigations.\n",
    "- benefit_reinforcement\n",
    "  - Reiterating concrete benefits and value after objections or hesitations, often tying back to the customer’s stated needs.\n",
    "- risk_reduction_trust_building\n",
    "  - Providing security assurances, privacy protections, non-hard-pull options, guarantees, terms clarity, or brand trust signals.\n",
    "- call_to_action_closing\n",
    "  - Concrete next steps or commitments: soft checks, secure links, email/mail options, scheduling follow-ups, or instructions to apply/get more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to apply the rules\n",
    "- For every transcript, read from start to finish. Mark each pillar as soon as its criteria are clearly demonstrated.\n",
    "- If a single utterance clearly satisfies more than one pillar, count it under all applicable pillars.\n",
    "- If a pillar is not clearly demonstrated anywhere in the transcript, do not include it in the categories list.\n",
    "- Record the detected pillars in the exact order of their first appearance in the transcript.\n",
    "- The final_result should reflect the overall trajectory of the call as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output constraints and format\n",
    "- Do not introduce any facts not present in the transcript.\n",
    "- Do not insert subjective opinions beyond what is grounded in the transcript.\n",
    "- Use the exact section headings and formatting:\n",
    "  reasoning\n",
    "  categories\n",
    "  final_result\n",
    "- Do not include extraneous content beyond the three sections above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Domain-specific considerations\n",
    "- You may encounter references to soft pulls vs hard pulls, online applications, secure links, email follow-ups, or scheduled follow-ups. Treat these as legitimate “call_to_action_closing” or “risk_reduction_trust_building” elements as appropriate.\n",
    "- When quoting or paraphrasing, keep quotes brief and focused on the reason for the pillar.\n",
    "- If PII appears in the transcript (e.g., partial SSN or addresses), quote minimally and do not reveal full sensitive data in your justification. You may paraphrase or reference the presence of sensitive data without reproducing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example behavior (not to reproduce here)\n",
    "- A transcript with strong, explicit next steps to apply or pre-qualify is more conversion-oriented; a transcript focusing solely on questions and reassurance without a clear next step is more retention-oriented or mixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "End result\n",
    "- Return exactly three sections for every transcript analyzed, with the content governed by the rules above. This format enables consistent, comparable, and transparent analysis across transcripts.\"\"\""

    "  (b) judge the likely business outcome of the call (conversion, retention, or mixed).\n",
    "\n",

    "- A complete transcript of a single call between an agent and a customer. Transcripts may include labels such as \"agent:\" and \"customer:\" and may cover topics like card offers, fees, rewards, security, and next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you must produce (three sections exactly)\n",
    "1) reasoning\n",
    "   - Provide a concise, bullets-style justification for every pillar category you detected in the transcript.\n",
    "   - Include short quotes or paraphrases from the transcript to illustrate why the category applies. Do not introduce facts or assumptions beyond what is in the transcript.\n",
    "   - If you detect a strength/weakness signal about the outcome, include a brief, one- to two-sentence note here describing how strong the signal is and what would push it toward conversion or toward retention.\n",
    "   - This section may contain a small, optional note about outcome strength, but must not introduce information outside the transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) categories\n",

    "### How GEPA Works Under the Hood\n",
    "\n",
    "Before showing the code, let's understand what GEPA actually does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reflective Mutation** — Unlike random genetic mutation, GEPA's LLM *reads the failure feedback* and proposes targeted improvements. It's not guessing—it's reasoning about what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pareto Selection** — Instead of keeping only the single best prompt, GEPA maintains a \"frontier\" of diverse specialists. One prompt might excel at detecting objection handling; another at predicting call outcomes. This prevents catastrophic forgetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Text-as-Feedback** — Traditional RL uses scalar rewards. GEPA exploits rich textual feedback (\"You incorrectly marked this as rapport-building because...\") to guide mutations more precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running GEPA\n",
    "\n",
    "With prerequisites in place, the optimizer setup is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dspy import GEPA\n",
    "\n",
    "optimizer = GEPA(\n",
    "    metric=metric_with_feedback,  # Returns score + textual feedback for failures\n",
    "    auto=\"light\",                 # Budget setting (use \"heavy\" for production)\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "optimized_program = optimizer.compile(\n",
    "    program,\n",
    "    trainset=train_set,\n",
    "    valset=val_set,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I Observed\n",
    "\n",
    "My 2-line prompt evolved into a ~1,500 word instruction set. The optimizer discovered things I'd never explicitly taught it: precise definitions for each category, rules for ambiguous cases (\"a bare greeting isn't rapport-building—look for warmth and time acknowledgment\"), and domain-specific guidance about soft pulls and secure application links.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result: 72% → 81% accuracy. More importantly, the process was repeatable. I wasn't guessing anymore—I had a system."
